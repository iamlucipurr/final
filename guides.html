    <h3><a href="#">170 Trials guide</a></h3>
    <div class="col-lg-offset-2 col-lg-12">
    
    <p>Lithhriss’ guide for trials and gauntlets at level 170 as offtank<br/><br/>

Level 170 trials and gauntlets have a chance to drop items from the newest sets: Taldrilth's Artifacts and Bushido. Taldrilth’s Artifacts is a set consisting of a head, body and neck with tank bonuses: 2 / 3 gives 2% deflect and 3 / 3 gives 5% absorb. Bushido is a set consisting of an offhand and body with dps bonuses: 2 / 2 gives 10% increased damage, but you take 10% increased damage as well. These sets are very good, but level 170 can be quite hard to beat.<br/><br/>

You can start doing trials manually at around 1350ts and gauntlet at around 1400ts. At that level you have to spend pots every run and even then you will lose some. At 1500ts you can safely manual around half the time in gauntlet (the difficulty difference between bosses in gauntlet is huge). But even at that level you should be prepared to manual all bosses, as bad RNG can always take you down.<br/><br/>

      <strong>Build</strong><br/>
After testing a few different builds, hybrid offtank seemed to have the best and most consistent results. While this guide has tips for every fight, it will mostly be focused on this build.<br/><br/>

      <strong>Stat distribution</strong><br/>
With stats of around 600/500/400 you make optimal use of legendary pets and you can do significant damage. Overall 500 stamina is enough to survive and sometimes less will do. <br/><br/>

      <strong>Runes</strong><br/>
A Kor rune is nice to have as you often drop low on health on some bosses, but it can be risky to game it. A Sol rune can be good for some targeting minibosses, but overall it feels bad when you’re running with only 500 stamina. Since it’s a hybrid build, any major runes will do.<br/><br/>

      <strong>Familiars</strong><br/>
The best familiars to accompany you in this build are 2 Wemmbos. It’s obviously a big help if you have 5/5 stabled.<br/><br/>

      <strong>Pets</strong><br/>
Boiguh is the recommended pet for gauntlet as you can build a big shield during the waves and that helps against the spear bosses. Gemmi is better for trials since its throughput is higher and there is more targeting damage. <br/><br/>

      <strong>Build weaknesses</strong><br/>
The biggest weakness of this build is not being able to target without buildup. Wemmbo has a strong 2sp target, but he rarely gets to 2sp while on auto. As an offtank, your best weapon is an axe, which is also lacking a 1sp target. In gauntlet, this is generally not an issue, but in trials it can be. When you’re at a lower ts, consider building up SP in the fight prior to a hard miniboss so you can pounce it four times. For gauntlet, you should start building up SP at around wave 8.<br/>
